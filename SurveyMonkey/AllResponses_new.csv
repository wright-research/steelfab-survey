Sadly, it has been an assimilation since our leaders from the Norcross office rarely have their voices heard anymore.

I have witnessed him practices active listening and respond in a way that reassures them that he was listening. However, when he and I engage, it turns into a one-sided affair while many of my ideas are misinterpreted or dismissed. He's a manager but he is not a leader.

It saddens my heart when ""new blood"" comes into the company and ruin the moral of hard workers due to their personal agendas or fragile egos. SteelFab Inc. is a family. I believe people need to remember this when placed into positions of authority. Stuart and Glenn have maintained the utmost professionalism, and they have used their authority to mentor, train, and develop many workers; me included. However, if anyone joins the SteelFab Inc. family and doesn't mimic their leadership examples, then that person is not fit to lead (in my opinion). I have a team of workers that look up to me for guidance, training, and knowledge on my subject matter. I do my best to serve them, so they feel valued and heard. I believe I am worth the same when engaging with my manager too. It doesn't happen yet it doesn't stop me from doing my job and treating others with the utmost respect (regardless of their titles).",Gratitude & Appreciation

I feel that our pay scale for our department could be better. Every role in the company is vital to overall success of the company. However, it feels like we are under appreciated based on the pay scale. I was on the shop floor before my position as programmer. I was able to learn and operate all of our CNC machines. We have 9 machines in the PLATE department, not including the Robotic Welding, Shear & Press.         I am now programming for all of our machines. My previous experience and training have given me the necessary skills & knowledge to perform my duties. I feel it is required to have machining background in order to be successful in programming. Understanding how our machines and shop function will ensure productivity and efficiency.       Our company motto is ""Continuous  Improvement"" and I truly believe in this. It is why I strive to learn everything I can about the various day to day operations in the company. Although my experiences & skills have given me an advantage as a programmer. I feel it does not reflect that on our pay scale.    2.  A majority of our time is spent looking over and editing drawings, numbers, coordinates, dimensions & machine codes. Programming work involves a lot of focus and concentrations. One wrong keystroke can cause issues on the machines and impact shop productivity. Being in the shop office can be very distracting with the constant foot traffic, grinding and banging from the shop. With that said, it would be great if we could relocate to a separate office away from the main shop.",Compensation & Benefits,It would be great if we still have UTO. They are very helpful and useful for us when we have issues outside of work. When we would only need an hour or two sporadically. Or issue UTO either quarterly to prevent misuse.,Company Policy

Estimators can learn to do on screen take offs using the Bluebeam tools (I created tools for all the AISC shapes we use) to trace the main members, and export to Excel, added section cuts into that excel list, then import it all into Tekla. They also have portable workstations designed for the shop workers, field foremen and project managers in mind. I am not sure if this is right for SteelFab as a whole organization, I do think it that it could be a good move for estimators open to learning onscreen takeoffs and reducing paper printing, if management is open to the Invesment.",Physical Environment
